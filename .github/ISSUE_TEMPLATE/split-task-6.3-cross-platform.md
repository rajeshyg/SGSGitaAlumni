Suggested split for `docs/progress/phase-6/task-6.3-cross-platform.md` (1257 lines):

- Part A: Cross-platform overview and goals (overview)
- Part B: Platform-specific implementation notes (Web, Mobile, Desktop)
- Part C: Test matrix and QA checklist

Estimated effort: 2-4 hours

Rationale: Reduces file size, improves discoverability, and makes future updates smaller and easier to review.
