# Implementation Plan Template

# Plan: [Feature Name]

## Purpose
[One sentence: what this plan accomplishes]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences on approach]

## Workflow
This plan follows the Scout-Plan-Build pattern:

1. **Scout Phase** (Complete before planning)
   - [ ] Identify all related files
   - [ ] Document existing patterns
   - [ ] Note dependencies
   - Output: `docs/specs/scouts/[feature]-discovery.md`

2. **Plan Phase** (This document)
   - [ ] Design architecture changes
   - [ ] Break into implementation phases
   - [ ] Identify risks and mitigations

3. **Build Phase** (After plan approval)
   - [ ] Execute phases sequentially
   - [ ] Validate each phase before proceeding
   - [ ] Update documentation

## Architecture Changes
- [Component modifications]
- [New services/modules]
- [Database schema changes]

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: [Foundation]
**Goal**: [What this phase accomplishes]
**Model**: Sonnet (standard implementation)

- [ ] Step 1.1: [Specific action]
- [ ] Step 1.2: [Specific action]

**Validation**: [How to verify phase completion]
**Checkpoint**: [What must be true before Phase 2]

### Phase 2: [Core Logic]
**Goal**: [What this phase accomplishes]
**Model**: Sonnet (standard implementation)

- [ ] Step 2.1: [Specific action]
- [ ] Step 2.2: [Specific action]

**Validation**: [How to verify phase completion]
**Checkpoint**: [What must be true before Phase 3]

### Phase 3: [Integration]
**Goal**: [What this phase accomplishes]
**Model**: Sonnet (standard implementation)

- [ ] Step 3.1: [Specific action]
- [ ] Step 3.2: [Specific action]

**Validation**: [How to verify phase completion]

## Dependencies
- [External libraries]
- [Other features/services]
- [Infrastructure requirements]

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: [coverage areas]
- Integration tests: [scenarios]
- E2E tests: [critical paths]

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Medium/Low | [Approach] |

## Rollback Plan
[How to revert if issues arise]

## Report
Upon completion, provide:
- **Phases Completed**: Status of each phase
- **Deviations**: Any changes from original plan
- **Lessons Learned**: What to improve next time
- **Follow-up Items**: Deferred work or improvements
