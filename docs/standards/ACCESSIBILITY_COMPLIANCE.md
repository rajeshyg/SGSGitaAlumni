# Accessibility Compliance Standards

This document defines the accessibility standards, requirements, and compliance targets for achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in the SGSGita Alumni project.

## üéØ WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Overview

### Four Core Principles (POUR)
- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents

### Conformance Levels
- **A (Lowest)**: Basic accessibility support
- **AA (Recommended)**: Enhanced accessibility with important barriers removed
- **AAA (Highest)**: Highest accessibility with all barriers removed

**Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components and features.
