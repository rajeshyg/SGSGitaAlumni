# Security Requirements

This document defines the security standards, requirements, and compliance targets for the SGSGita Alumni project. All security implementations must adhere to these requirements.

## üîê Core Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

- **Secure Development**: Security considerations in every development phase
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security event detection and response
- **Incident Response**: Structured approach to security incidents

## üõ°Ô∏è Authentication Requirements

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Mandatory MFA**: Required for all administrative accounts
- **Optional MFA**: Available for all user accounts
- **TOTP Support**: Time-based one-time passwords (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- **SMS Backup**: SMS-based verification as fallback option
- **Recovery Codes**: Secure backup codes for account recovery

### Password Requirements
- **Minimum Length**: 12 characters
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- **Password History**: Prevent reuse of last 12 passwords
- **Expiration**: No forced expiration (following NIST guidelines)
- **Breach Detection**: Check against known compromised passwords

### Session Management
- **Session Timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite attributes
- **Session Rotation**: New session ID after authentication
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Maximum 3 active sessions per user

## üîí Data Protection Requirements

### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud KMS
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic rotation every 90 days

### Data Classification
- **Public**: No protection required
- **Internal**: Access controls and audit logging
- **Confidential**: Encryption and strict access controls
- **Restricted**: Highest security measures and monitoring

### Personal Data Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary personal data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **Retention Limits**: Delete data when no longer needed
- **User Rights**: Support for access, rectification, and deletion

## üåê API Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0**: Standard authentication protocol
- **JWT Tokens**: Signed JSON Web Tokens for API access
- **Scope-Based Access**: Fine-grained permission system
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Input Validation
- **Schema Validation**: All inputs validated against strict schemas
- **Sanitization**: Remove or escape potentially dangerous content
- **Size Limits**: Enforce maximum payload sizes
- **Content Type Validation**: Verify expected content types

### Output Security
- **Data Filtering**: Remove sensitive data from responses
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security header implementation

## üìä Monitoring & Audit Requirements

### Security Event Logging
- **Authentication Events**: All login attempts and outcomes
- **Authorization Events**: Access grants and denials
- **Data Access**: All access to sensitive data
- **Administrative Actions**: All system configuration changes

### Audit Trail Requirements
- **Immutable Logs**: Tamper-evident audit trails
- **Log Retention**: Minimum 7 years for compliance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Immediate alerting for security events
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly security log analysis

### Incident Response
- **Detection**: Automated threat detection and alerting
- **Response Time**: Maximum 1 hour for critical incidents
- **Communication**: Stakeholder notification procedures
- **Recovery**: Business continuity and disaster recovery plans

## üìã Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance
- **Lawful Basis**: Clear legal basis for all data processing
- **Consent Management**: Granular consent collection and management
- **Data Subject Rights**: Support for all GDPR rights
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations in all system design
- **Data Protection Officer**: Designated DPO for compliance oversight

### SOC 2 Compliance
- **Security**: Logical and physical access controls
- **Availability**: System availability and performance monitoring
- **Processing Integrity**: Complete and accurate data processing
- **Confidentiality**: Protection of confidential information
- **Privacy**: Collection, use, retention, and disposal of personal information

### HIPAA Compliance (if applicable)
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Security officer and workforce training
- **Physical Safeguards**: Facility access controls and workstation use
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access control, audit controls, integrity, transmission security

## üîß Implementation Standards

### Security Testing Requirements
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code security scanning
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular vulnerability scanning and remediation

### Security Training
- **Developer Training**: Secure coding practices and OWASP Top 10
- **User Training**: Security awareness and phishing prevention
- **Incident Response Training**: Regular drills and simulations
- **Compliance Training**: Regulatory requirements and procedures

### Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment**: Annual comprehensive risk assessments
- **Risk Register**: Maintained inventory of identified risks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Documented mitigation strategies
- **Risk Monitoring**: Continuous risk monitoring and reporting

## üìà Security Metrics & KPIs

### Performance Indicators
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: Target < 15 minutes
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: Target < 1 hour
- **Security Training Completion**: 100% annual completion
- **Vulnerability Remediation**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours

### Compliance Metrics
- **Audit Findings**: Zero critical findings in annual audits
- **Policy Compliance**: 100% compliance with security policies
- **Incident Response**: 100% incidents responded to within SLA
- **Data Breach Prevention**: Zero preventable data breaches

## üö® Security Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise, or service unavailability
- **High**: Unauthorized access attempt or significant vulnerability
- **Medium**: Policy violation or minor security event
- **Low**: Informational security event or false positive

### Response Requirements
- **Critical**: Immediate response, executive notification, external communication
- **High**: Response within 2 hours, management notification
- **Medium**: Response within 24 hours, security team notification
- **Low**: Response within 72 hours, routine handling
