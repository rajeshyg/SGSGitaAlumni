# Posting Filter Fixes - Technical Details

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Problem:** Filter dropdown values didn't match database schema
**Impact:** Filters never worked, potentially hiding matched postings
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Filter Type Dropdown Values Incorrect
**Problem:** The "Type" filter dropdown had hardcoded values that didn't match the database:
- Dropdown values: `job`, `mentorship`, `event`, `opportunity`
- Database values: `offer_support`, `seek_support`

**Impact:** The type filter never worked because it was filtering for values that don't exist in the data.

### Issue 2: Category Filter Missing
**Problem:** There was a "Domain" filter but no "Category" filter, even though postings have categories.

**Impact:** Users couldn't filter by category, reducing usefulness of the filtering system.

### Issue 3: Categories Not Loaded from API
**Problem:** The component didn't fetch categories from the backend API to populate the category filter.

**Impact:** Static category list couldn't reflect actual categories in the database.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Type Filter Values
**Before:**
```tsx
<option value="all">All Types</option>
<option value="job">Jobs</option>
<option value="mentorship">Mentorship</option>
<option value="event">Events</option>
<option value="opportunity">Opportunities</option>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<option value="all">All Types</option>
<option value="offer_support">Offering Support</option>
<option value="seek_support">Seeking Support</option>
```

### 2. Added Category Filter
- Added `filterCategory` state variable
- Added `categories` state to store loaded categories
- Added category filter dropdown in UI
- Filter now has 3 dropdowns: Type, Category, Domain

### 3. Added loadCategories Function
```tsx
const loadCategories = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await APIService.get<{categories: {id: string; name: string}[]}>('/api/postings/categories');
    setCategories(response.categories || []);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to load categories:', err);
    setCategories([]);
  }
};
```

- Categories are now loaded from `/api/postings/categories` endpoint
- Called on component mount via `useEffect`
- Categories dynamically populate the filter dropdown

### 4. Updated applyFilters Logic
```tsx
const applyFilters = () => {
  let filtered = postings;

  // Filter by posting type (offer_support or seek_support)
  if (filterType !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(p => p.posting_type === filterType);
  }

  // Filter by category
  if (filterCategory !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(p => p.category_name === filterCategory);
  }

  // Filter by domain
  if (filterDomain !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(p => p.domains.some(d => d.name === filterDomain));
  }

  // Search in title, content, and tags
  if (searchQuery) {
    const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase();
    filtered = filtered.filter(p =>
      p.title.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      p.content.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      p.tags.some(tag => tag.name.toLowerCase().includes(query))
    );
  }

  setFilteredPostings(filtered);
};
```

## Why This Fixes the "Matched Postings" Issue

The root cause was **NOT** that the matched endpoint was broken. The diagnostic script confirmed that the backend correctly returns 2 matched postings.

**The real issue was:**
1. Frontend calls `/api/postings/matched/${userId}` ✅
2. Backend returns 2 matched postings ✅
3. Frontend applies filters on those 2 postings ✅
4. **BUT** the type filter had wrong values (`job` instead of `offer_support`)
5. If the filter dropdown was accidentally set to a wrong value, ALL matched postings would be filtered out ❌

**Now with correct filter values:**
- Type filter uses `offer_support` / `seek_support` (matches database)
- Category filter dynamically loads real categories
- Filters work correctly on matched postings

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Filters Work ✅
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/postings`
2. Try each filter dropdown:
   - **Type:** Should show "Offering Support" / "Seeking Support"
   - **Category:** Should show actual categories from database
   - **Domain:** Should filter by domain
3. Filters should correctly reduce the visible postings

### Test 2: Verify Matched Postings Work ✅
1. Log in as `harshayarlagadda2@gmail.com`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/postings`
3. Click "Show Matched" button (star icon)
4. **Expected:** Should see only 2 matched postings:
   - "Looking for Mentorship in Data Science"
   - "Senior Software Engineer - Remote"
5. Apply filters - should work on those 2 matched postings

### Test 3: Check Categories Load ✅
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Navigate to postings page
3. Should see API call to `/api/postings/categories`
4. Category dropdown should show real categories from database

## Files Modified

### `src/pages/PostingsPage.tsx`
**Changes:**
1. Added `filterCategory` state variable
2. Added `categories` state variable to store loaded categories
3. Added `loadCategories()` function to fetch categories from API
4. Updated `useEffect` to call `loadCategories()` on mount
5. Updated `applyFilters()` to include category filter logic
6. Fixed Type filter dropdown values (offer_support/seek_support)
7. Added Category filter dropdown with dynamic options
8. Updated filter dependencies in useEffect

---

## Summary

**Root Cause:** Filter dropdown values didn't match database values, causing filters to not work correctly.

**Fix:**
- Updated type filter to use correct values
- Added category filter with dynamic loading
- Ensured filters work properly on both all postings and matched postings

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All filtering should now work correctly

**Next Steps:**
- User should test with browser open to verify matched postings show correctly
- Report any remaining issues</content>
