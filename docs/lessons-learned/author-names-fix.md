# Author Names Fix - Technical Details

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Problem:** Postings displayed "Posted by null null" or "Anonymous"
**Root Cause:** 150+ users with NULL first_name/last_name in database
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## The Problem

Postings displayed "Posted by null null" or "Posted by Anonymous" instead of proper author names.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation
```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email FROM app_users WHERE id = 2;
-- Result: 2, NULL, NULL, test@example.com
```

**Root Cause:** Many users in the database had NULL names due to incomplete data migration or registration.

---

## Fix Applied

**Script:** `scripts/debug/fix-null-authors.js`

**Logic:**
1. Find all users with NULL first_name or last_name
2. Try to populate from linked `alumni_members` table
3. If still NULL, set to "Anonymous User"

**Execution:**
```bash
node scripts/debug/fix-null-authors.js
# Run 3 times to fix all users (50 per batch)
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Fixed 150+ users
- ✅ Names populated from alumni_members where available
- ✅ Remaining users set to "Anonymous User"

3. ✅ Should see real names or "Anonymous User" instead of "null null"
