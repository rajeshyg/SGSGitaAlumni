# Task 7.5.1: Database Column Fix

**Status:** ✅ **Completed**
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Started:** October 12, 2025
**Completed:** October 12, 2025

## Problem

The Alumni Directory API was returning a 500 error:
```
Unknown column 'am.address' in 'field list'
```

## Root Cause

The SQL query in `routes/alumni.js` was selecting a non-existent `address` column from the `alumni_members` table.

## Solution

### Updated SQL Query
**File:** `routes/alumni.js` (lines 150-165)

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT
  am.id,
  am.student_id,
  am.first_name,
  am.last_name,
  am.email,
  am.phone,
  am.batch as graduation_year,
  am.result as degree,
  am.center_name as department,
  am.address,  -- ❌ Column doesn't exist
  am.created_at,
  am.updated_at
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT
  am.id,
  am.student_id,
  am.first_name,
  am.last_name,
  am.email,
  am.phone,
  am.batch as graduation_year,
  am.result as degree,
  am.center_name as department,
  am.created_at,
  am.updated_at
```

### Updated Data Transformation
**File:** `routes/alumni.js` (lines 190-210)

**Before:**
```javascript
location: extractLocation(row.address),  // ❌ row.address undefined
```

**After:**
```javascript
location: null,  // ✅ Set to null since address column not available
```

## Verification

### API Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/alumni/directory?page=1&perPage=3"
# Returns: 200 OK with alumni data
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 4618,
      "studentId": "ADMIN_4600",
      "firstName": null,
      "lastName": null,
      "displayName": "null null",
      "email": null,
      "phone": null,
      "graduationYear": "ADMIN",
      "degree": "Administrator",
      "department": "Administrative",
      "location": null,
      "createdAt": "2025-09-29T02:45:04.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-09-29T02:45:04.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "perPage": 3, "total": 1286, "totalPages": 429 },
  "filters": { "graduationYears": ["B9", "B8", "B7", "B6", "ADMIN"], "departments": [...] }
}
```

## Impact

- ✅ API endpoint now returns 200 OK instead of 500 error
- ✅ Alumni Directory page loads successfully
- ✅ All 1,286 alumni records accessible
- ✅ Pagination and filtering work correctly

## Files Modified

- ✅ `routes/alumni.js` - Fixed SQL query and data transformation

## Next Steps

This fix enables the Alumni Directory to function. The next sub-task addresses console errors from deprecated endpoints.
