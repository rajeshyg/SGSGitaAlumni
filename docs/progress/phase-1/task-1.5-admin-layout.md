# Task 1.5: Update Admin Page Layout (No Mock Logic)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Description:** Refactor the Admin page to use imported components and the theme system, with real or minimal placeholder data. Do not use prototype mock logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AdminPage uses prototype components and theme tokens
- No mock/demo business logic remains
- Layout matches design patterns from the prototype

## Notes
This is a lightweight stub created to satisfy link references in README and documentation navigation. Full implementation details are present in the Phase 1 task history and codebase.
