## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface AdvancedDataTableProps<T = any> {
  title?: string
  columns: ColumnDef<T>[]
  searchKey?: string
  enableExport?: boolean
  className?: string
}

export function AdvancedDataTable<TData = any>({
  title = "Data Table",
  columns,
  searchKey,
  enableExport = true,
  className = ""
}: AdvancedDataTableProps<TData>) {
  // Implementation with search, export, loading states
}
```

### Features Implemented
- **Search Functionality:** Debounced search with real-time filtering
- **Export Capabilities:** CSV and JSON export with blob generation
- **Loading States:** Skeleton components with smooth transitions
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error boundaries with retry options
- **Lazy Loading:** React.lazy for performance optimization
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-optimized layouts and interactions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting:** Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- **Debounced Search:** Prevents excessive API calls
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of event listeners
- **Suspense Boundaries:** Smooth loading state transitions
