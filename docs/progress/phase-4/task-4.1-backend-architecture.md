# Task 4.1: Backend Architecture Analysis

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

## Overview
Review and analyze the existing FastAPI backend setup, database schema, and infrastructure to ensure compatibility with frontend requirements.

## Objectives
- Assess current FastAPI server implementation
- Review database schema and relationships
- Evaluate existing API endpoints
- Identify integration points with frontend
- Document architectural decisions and constraints

## Deliverables
- Backend architecture assessment report
- Database schema documentation
- API endpoint inventory
- Integration requirements specification
- Architecture recommendation document

## Technical Requirements
- FastAPI server analysis (server.js, server-package.json)
- MySQL database schema review
- AWS services integration assessment
- Security architecture evaluation
- Performance baseline establishment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete backend architecture documented
- [ ] Database schema mapped to frontend requirements
- [ ] API endpoints inventoried and categorized
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Security and performance baselines established

## Dependencies
- Access to existing FastAPI server code
- Database schema documentation
- AWS services configuration details
- Frontend API requirements specification

## Risk Assessment
- **Low:** Existing server code may need refactoring
- **Medium:** Database schema may require modifications
- **High:** Security requirements may impact architecture

## Next Steps
1. Schedule backend code review session
2. Document current architecture
3. Identify integration requirements
4. Create architecture improvement plan
