# Task 4.3: S3 File Storage Integration

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 3-5 days

## Overview
Set up S3 file storage integration for user-generated content including profile pictures, attachments, and social media content with secure access controls.

## Objectives
- Configure S3 buckets for different content types
- Implement secure file upload and access system
- Set up presigned URLs for secure file access
- Configure file validation and security policies
- Implement file organization and metadata tracking

## S3 Bucket Configuration

### Bucket Structure
- **Profile Pictures**: `sgs-alumni-profile-pictures`
  - User avatars and profile images
  - Image optimization and resizing
  - Access control with presigned URLs

- **Attachments**: `sgs-alumni-attachments`
  - Document files and attachments
  - File type validation
  - Secure access controls

- **Social Content**: `sgs-alumni-social-content`
  - Social media posts and media
  - Video and image content
  - Public/private content management

### Security Features
- **Private Access**: All buckets configured with private ACL
- **Presigned URLs**: Secure temporary access to files
- **File Validation**: Type and size validation before upload
- **Metadata Tracking**: User ID and upload type tracking
- **CORS Configuration**: Frontend upload support

## File Upload Implementation
```typescript
// S3 File Upload Service
class S3FileUploadService {
  async uploadProfilePicture(file: File, userId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Validate file type (image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp)
    // Check file size (max 5MB)
    // Generate unique filename
    // Upload to S3 with private ACL
    // Return presigned URL for access
  }

  async uploadAttachment(file: File, userId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Validate file type (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
    // Check file size (max 10MB)
    // Upload to attachments bucket
    // Return secure access URL
  }

  async uploadSocialContent(file: File, userId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Validate file type (images, videos)
    // Check file size (max 15MB)
    // Upload to social content bucket
    // Return presigned URL
  }
}
```
