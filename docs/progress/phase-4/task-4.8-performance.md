# Task 4.8: Performance Optimization

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

## Overview
Backend performance monitoring and optimization for the alumni management system.

## Objectives
- Implement performance monitoring
- Optimize database queries and connections
- Configure caching strategies
- Set up performance alerting
- Establish performance baselines

## Performance Targets
- API response time: <200ms for simple requests
- Database query time: <100ms average
- File import processing: <5 seconds per 1000 records
- Concurrent users: 100+ supported
- Memory usage: <512MB per server instance

## Monitoring Requirements
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Database performance monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

## Optimization Areas
