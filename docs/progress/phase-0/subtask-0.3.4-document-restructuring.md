## Overview

Break down oversized documents into focused, manageable files that respect size limits while maintaining comprehensive coverage and improving usability.

## Problem Statement

### Oversized Documents Identified
The documentation consistency checker identified **23 documents exceeding size limits**:

#### Critical Oversized Documents:
1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** (807 lines â†’ target: 250 lines)
   - Covers architecture + security + accessibility + performance
   - Should focus only on architectural decisions

2. **SECURITY_FRAMEWORK.md** (880 lines â†’ target: 400 lines)
   - Extremely detailed implementation examples
   - Mix of framework and implementation guidance

3. **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md** (747 lines â†’ target: 300 lines)
   - Covers development + theme + component + security + accessibility
   - Should focus only on core development practices

4. **ACCESSIBILITY_STANDARDS.md** (680 lines â†’ target: 400 lines)
   - Overly detailed examples
   - Mix of standards and implementation

5. **CROSS_PLATFORM_GUIDELINES.md** (606 lines â†’ target: 300 lines)
   - Detailed but could be more focused
   - Platform-specific content could be separated

6. **NATIVE_FIRST_STANDARDS.md** (550 lines â†’ target: 400 lines)
   - Comprehensive but dense
   - Performance and implementation mixed

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce Document Sizes**: All documents within appropriate size limits
2. **Improve Focus**: Each document covers a single, well-defined topic
3. **Maintain Completeness**: No loss of important information
4. **Enhance Usability**: Easier navigation and consumption
5. **Preserve References**: All existing links continue to work

### Success Metrics
- **All documents within size limits** (300-500 lines based on type)
- **Improved document focus** and single responsibility
- **Zero information loss** during restructuring
- **Maintained backward compatibility** for existing references
- **Enhanced navigation** between related documents

## Restructuring Plan
