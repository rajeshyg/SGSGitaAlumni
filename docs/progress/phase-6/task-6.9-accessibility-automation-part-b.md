# Task 6.9 (Part B): Accessibility Automation Framework â€” CI Integration, Reporting & Metrics

## Overview

Part B focuses on CI integration, reporting, inclusive metrics, testing strategies, remediation workflows, and risk management for the accessibility automation framework.

## CI Integration

### Goals
- Continuous accessibility checks on PRs and mainline branches
- Actionable reports for developers with file/line references
- Failure gating for high-severity accessibility regressions

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Add a workflow `accessibility-quality.yml` that runs on PRs and pushes SARIF and HTML reports

Example snippet:
```yaml
name: Accessibility Quality
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'docs/**'

jobs:
  accessibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run accessibility tests
        run: |
          node ./scripts/run-accessibility-tests.js --output reports/accessibility
      - name: Upload accessibility report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: accessibility-reports
          path: reports/accessibility
```

### Reporter Outputs
- SARIF for code scanning integrations
- HTML reports for human review
- JSON summaries for dashboarding and metrics ingestion

## Inclusive Metrics & Reporting

### Core Metrics
- Accessibility Coverage (automated): % of pages/components passing automated checks
- Assistive Technology Compatibility Score: composite score across tested ATs
- Cognitive Load Index: automated estimate based on heuristics
- Time-to-Remediate: average time to fix high-severity accessibility issues

### Dashboards
- Push JSON summaries to monitoring/analytics (e.g., DataDog/Prometheus/Grafana) for trend analysis

## Testing & Validation

### Test Types
- Unit-level accessibility assertions
- Integration testing with screen readers (headless when possible)
- End-to-end multi-modal tests (Voice/Gesture/Keyboard)
- Visual regression checks for contrast and focus states

### Test Harness
- Use Puppeteer/Playwright for headless interactions
- Use axe-core for automated WCAG checks
- Incorporate mocked assistive technologies for CI

## Remediation Workflow

### Developer Experience
- Inline code suggestions in PR for quick fixes
- Linkary: direct links from issues to failing lines in code
- Auto-assign remediation tickets based on ownership map

### Escalation
- High severity failures leave the PR blocked and create an auto issue in the backlog

## Risk, Mitigation & Rollback

### Risks
- Overblocking PRs due to false positives
- High maintenance cost for assistive technology simulation

### Mitigation
- Use flakiness allowance for non-deterministic checks
- Create a manual review triage queue for false positives

## Next Steps
1. Implement `run-accessibility-tests.js` script in `scripts/`
2. Add `accessibility-quality.yml` workflow and wire reporting artifacts
3. Start with a pilot scope (10 core pages/components)
