# Task 6.6 (Part 4): Compliance Validation — Appendices & Tests

## Testing & Validation

This appendix contains the testing examples, test suites, success criteria, quality requirements, and next steps.

```typescript
// src/test/compliance-validation.test.ts

// ...test examples (see original Task 6.6)
```

## Next Steps

1. Execute Compliance Tests
2. Review Critical Issues
3. Generate Final Reports
4. Stakeholder Review
5. Production Deployment
6. Post-Deployment Validation
