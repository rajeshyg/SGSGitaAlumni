# Cross-Platform Development Guidelines

## Device Support Matrix

| Feature | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Touch Support | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Use touch events on touch devices |
| Hover States | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Avoid hover-only interactions |
| Minimum Touch Target | 44px | 32px | N/A | Follow platform guidelines |
| Keyboard Navigation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full keyboard support required |
| Screen Reader | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Device Detection
Always use the centralized device detection system:

```typescript
import { deviceDetector } from '@/lib/device-detection'

const capabilities = deviceDetector.getCapabilities()
if (capabilities.type === 'mobile') {
  // Mobile-specific logic
}
```

### 2. Platform-Adaptive Components
Use the PlatformAdaptive component for device-specific implementations:

```typescript
<PlatformAdaptive
  components={{
    mobile: MobileButton,
    tablet: TabletButton,
    desktop: DesktopButton
  }}
  onClick={handleClick}
/>
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
Apply platform-specific optimizations:

```typescript
import { performanceOptimizer } from '@/lib/performance-optimization'

const config = performanceOptimizer.getConfig()
// Use config values for platform-specific behavior
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on actual devices (not just browser dev tools)
- [ ] Verify touch targets meet minimum size requirements
- [ ] Test orientation changes on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Validate keyboard navigation on all platforms
- [ ] Check performance metrics across devices
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Verify cross-browser compatibility
```

## Next Steps

1. **Device Testing Setup** - Configure testing devices and emulators
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Establish baseline performance metrics
3. **Accessibility Audit** - Conduct WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit
4. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Set up automated cross-browser testing
5. **Documentation Review** - Update component documentation with platform notes

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Issues
1. **False Device Detection** - Use multiple detection methods
2. **Touch Event Conflicts** - Prevent default behaviors appropriately
3. **Performance Degradation** - Monitor and optimize for each platform
4. **Layout Shifts** - Use proper responsive design techniques
5. **Browser Inconsistencies** - Test on actual browsers, not just dev tools

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Set up performance monitoring per platform
- Alert on cross-platform compatibility issues
- Monitor touch interaction success rates
- Track accessibility compliance metrics
