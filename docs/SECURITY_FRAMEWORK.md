# Security Framework

**‚ö†Ô∏è OVERVIEW DOCUMENT**: This provides a high-level overview of security architecture. For detailed implementation, see the linked authoritative documents below.

## üìã Security Documentation Structure

This security framework is organized into focused documents:

- **[Security Requirements](./standards/SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md)** - Authoritative security standards and compliance requirements
- **[Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Detailed code examples and implementation patterns
- **[Compliance Framework](./security/COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORK.md)** - GDPR, SOC 2, and regulatory compliance procedures

## üîê Core Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: No single point of failure
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum required access for all operations
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configuration
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify

### Security by Design
- **Threat Modeling**: Proactive identification of security risks
- **Secure Development**: Security considerations in every development phase
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security event detection and response
- **Incident Response**: Structured approach to security incidents

## üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#mfa-implementation)** for complete MFA implementation examples and patterns.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#rbac-implementation)** for complete RBAC implementation examples and React integration patterns.

## üîí Data Protection & Encryption

### Client-Side Encryption
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#encryption-implementation)** for complete encryption service implementation and secure storage patterns.

### API Security
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#api-security)** for secure API client implementation with token refresh and error handling.

## üìä Security Monitoring & Audit

### Security Event Logging
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#security-monitoring)** for comprehensive security event tracking, risk analysis, and alert systems.

### Session Management
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#session-management)** for secure session handling, timeout management, and concurrent session controls.

## üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation & Sanitization

### Comprehensive Input Validation
‚Üí **See [Security Implementation Guide](./security/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#input-validation)** for multi-layer input validation, sanitization, and XSS prevention.

## üìã Compliance Frameworks

### GDPR Compliance
‚Üí **See [Compliance Framework](./security/COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORK.md#gdpr-compliance)** for GDPR-compliant data handling, consent management, and user rights implementation.

### SOC 2 Compliance
‚Üí **See [Compliance Framework](./security/COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORK.md#soc2-compliance)** for SOC 2 control implementation and audit trail management.

## üéØ Security Quick Reference

### Authentication Standards
- Multi-factor authentication required for all admin accounts
- JWT tokens with secure refresh mechanism
- Session timeout: 30 minutes idle, 8 hours absolute

### Data Protection Standards
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Secure key management and rotation

### Access Control Standards
- Role-based permissions with least privilege
- Regular access reviews and deprovisioning
- Audit logging for all privileged operations

### Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance for EU user data
- SOC 2 Type II controls implementation
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
