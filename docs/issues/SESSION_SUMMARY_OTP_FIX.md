# Session Summary - OTP Authentication Fix

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All fixes applied successfully

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

User reported:
> "Maximum attempts exceeded. Please request a new OTP."

This error appeared **immediately** on the OTP verification page, even though:
- OTP was successfully generated (200 OK response)
- No previous attempts had been made
- Database showed 0 tokens existed

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Bug: Incorrect SQL Query in `getRemainingAttempts`

**Location**: `routes/otp.js` lines 282-307

**Issue**: The endpoint queried for tokens with `last_attempt_at` in the last hour, but:
- Newly generated tokens have `last_attempt_at = NULL`
- Query returned 0 when no tokens existed at all
- Frontend interpreted this as "0 attempts remaining"

**Original Query** (BROKEN):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM OTP_TOKENS
WHERE email = ?
  AND last_attempt_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
  AND is_used = FALSE
```

**Fixed Query**:
```sql
SELECT attempt_count
FROM OTP_TOKENS
WHERE email = ?
  AND is_used = FALSE
  AND expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Key Change**: 
- Now checks the most recent valid token's `attempt_count` field
- Returns 3 when no tokens exist (instead of 0)

## üìù Files Modified

### Backend Files (3 files)

1. **`routes/otp.js`**
   - Fixed `getRemainingAttempts` SQL query (lines 282-313)
   - Added console logging for OTP codes in dev mode (lines 77-88)

2. **`utils/emailService.js`**
   - Fixed dev mode detection in `sendOTPEmail` (lines 384-398)
   - Fixed dev mode detection in `sendInvitationEmail` (lines 420-434)
   - Now re-checks environment variables at runtime instead of constructor

3. **`server.js`**
   - No changes needed (already correct)

### Frontend Files (2 files)

4. **`src/services/OTPService.ts`**
   - Fixed `getRemainingOTPAttempts` response mapping (lines 167-175)
   - Changed `response.data.remainingAttempts` ‚Üí `response.remainingAttempts`
   - Changed error default from `0` ‚Üí `3`

5. **`src/pages/OTPVerificationPage.tsx`**
   - Added debug console logging (lines 95-109)
   - Now logs API calls and responses

## üîß Technical Changes Summary

### Change #1: Backend API Response Format
**File**: `routes/otp.js`

Added `maxAttempts` field to response:
```javascript
res.json({ 
  remainingAttempts: remaining,
  maxAttempts: maxAttempts  // NEW
});
```

### Change #2: Backend Dev Mode Logging
**File**: `routes/otp.js`

Added formatted console output:
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || process.env.DEV_LOG_OTP === 'true') {
  console.log('\n' + '='.repeat(65));
  console.log('üìß [OTP Service] EMAIL VERIFICATION CODE (Development Mode)');
  console.log(`OTP Code: ${otpCode}`);
  console.log('='.repeat(65) + '\n');
}
```

### Change #3: Email Service Runtime Checks
**File**: `utils/emailService.js`

Changed from constructor-based check to runtime check:
```javascript
// OLD (doesn't work - env vars not loaded yet)
if (this.skipEmail || this.devMode) { ... }

// NEW (works - checks at runtime)
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
const shouldSkip = process.env.DEV_SKIP_EMAIL === 'true' || this.skipEmail || this.devMode;
if (shouldSkip || isDev) { ... }
```

### Change #4: Frontend Error Handling
**File**: `src/services/OTPService.ts`

Improved error handling and defaults:
```javascript
// OLD
catch (error) {
  return 0;  // ‚ùå Causes "max attempts" error
}

// NEW
catch (error) {
  console.error('[OTPService] Error getting remaining attempts:', error);
  return 3;  // ‚úÖ Safe default
}
```

### Change #5: Frontend Debug Visibility
**File**: `src/pages/OTPVerificationPage.tsx`

Added console logging for debugging:
```javascript
console.log('[OTPVerificationPage] Checking remaining attempts for:', email);
console.log('[OTPVerificationPage] Remaining attempts received:', attempts);
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Pre-Test Cleanup
```bash
node clear-otp-tokens.js harshayarlagadda2@gmail.com
```

### Manual Test Flow
1. Start application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/login`
3. Click "Sign in without password"
4. Enter email: `harshayarlagadda2@gmail.com`
5. Click "Send Verification Code"
6. **Verify**: Redirects to `/verify-otp` with NO error message
7. **Verify**: Backend console shows OTP code
8. Enter OTP code from console
9. **Verify**: Successfully logs in

### API Endpoint Testing
```powershell
# Test remaining attempts endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:3001/api/otp/remaining-attempts/harshayarlagadda2@gmail.com"

# Should return: { remainingAttempts: 3, maxAttempts: 3 }
```
