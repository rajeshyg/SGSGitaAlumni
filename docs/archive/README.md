# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by the new spec-driven development framework.

## Contents

### progress/
Phase-based task documentation from the original development approach. These files tracked implementation details during development but have been replaced by the consolidated specifications in `/docs/specs/`.

**Note**: These files are kept for historical reference only. For current project status and requirements, refer to:
- `/docs/specs/` - Current specifications
- `/mvp_pending_tasks_report.html` - Project status report

## Why Archived?

The project is transitioning to a spec-driven development approach where:
1. Specifications are organized by feature domain (not by phase)
2. Functional and technical specs are separated
3. Status tracking is in the specs themselves
4. A single source of truth replaces scattered task files

## Safe to Delete?

These archived files can be deleted once the team has verified:
- [ ] All relevant information captured in new specs
- [ ] No active references to these files
- [ ] Git history preserved for future reference
