## üîç What Was Fixed?

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
npm run dev
```

### Can't see OTP code in console
Check that `.env` has:
```
NODE_ENV=development
DEV_LOG_OTP=true
```

### Still seeing "Maximum attempts exceeded"
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Clear OTP tokens: `node clear-otp-tokens.js harshayarlagadda2@gmail.com`
3. Restart server
4. Try again in an incognito/private window
